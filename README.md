Final exam - ISYS5002 

## Project Components 

###  Section 1: Iterative Prompt Engineering
- Used AI-assisted **pseudocode design** with planning from **Week 3: Planning Before Coding**.
- Refined the AI prompt twice using insights from **Week 4: Functions & Inputs** and **Week 5: Loops**.
- Critically analyzed each version of the pseudocode and referenced topics like **logical operators**, **print**, and **basic data types**.

###  Section 2: Debug & Correct Practice
- Debugged a broken version of a task manager using systematic techniques from **Week 12: Testing and Debugging**.
- Manually rewrote the corrected code using **lists**, **functions**, and **input validation**.
- Added **doctest** examples (from **Week 9**) for each function, using clear comments to explain the fixes.

###  Section 3: Weather API Debug & Refine
- Analyzed and refined a weather-fetching function using only **Week 8: Basic Exception Handling**.
- Rewrote the function with input validation and JSON parsing, including doctest examples with skipped external API calls.
- Compared it against an ideal version and reflected on concepts like **print-based error messaging**, **try/except**, and safe API response handling.

### Section 4: Manual Implementation & Reflection
- Re-implemented the CLI Task Manager manually based on the final pseudocode using techniques from **Weeks 4‚Äì6**.
- Followed **Week 5** loop structure and **Week 6** input validation style.
- Included clear **doctests** and inline comments explaining which week each concept came from.
- Completed a 200-word reflection on the learning journey, error handling mindset, and plans for future iterative refinement.

 CLI Task Manager

A simple **Command-Line Task Manager** built as part of the ISYS5002 Final Exam, applying only basic Python techniques up to **Week 10**.

## Project Overview

This program allows users to:

- üìå Add a task  
- üìÑ List all tasks  
- ‚ùå Remove a task by index (with confirmation)  
- üö™ Quit the program safely

The application stores tasks in memory using a Python list and handles user input with basic error checking. It follows techniques covered **from Weeks 3‚Äì10**, including:

- Lists and list methods (Week 4‚Äì5)  
- Functions and parameter use (Week 4)  
- Input validation and error handling using try/except (Week 6‚Äì8)  
- Menu display and loops (Week 5)  
- Basic doctest usage for testing functions (Week 9)
