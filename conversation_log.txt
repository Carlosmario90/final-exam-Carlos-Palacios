SECTION 1.  Iterative Prompt Engineering

You’re designing a CLI Task Manager that allows users to add, list, and remove tasks stored in memory.

Course Constraint Reminder
Your pseudocode must reflect only techniques taught through to Week 10:

Basic lists and dictionaries for data storage
Simple functions with parameters
Basic file operations (if needed for persistence)
While loops for menu systems
Try/except for basic error handling only

1.1 Initial Prompt & Pseudocode (8 marks)

ME>> SECTION 1.1 : INITIAL PROMPT
	
I need to create a simple command-line Task Manager in Python using only basic techniques from an introductory programming course.
The program should allow users to:

Add a task

List all tasks

Allow users to add new tasks

Remove a task

Exit the program when the user chooses

The pseudocode should include only topics to covered in the course such as basic lists and operations, inputs, display information (print)  data types, functions and methods, dictionaries for data storage. Follow a structured planning approach with clear steps.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Build a CLI task manager where users can add, list, and remove tasks.

INPUTS/OUTPUTS:
- Inputs: user’s menu choice, task description, task index
- Outputs: confirmation messages, task list display

PSEUDOCODE:

FUNCTION display_menu():
    DISPLAY "1. Add Task"
    DISPLAY "2. View Tasks"
    DISPLAY "3. Remove Task"
    DISPLAY "4. Exit"

FUNCTION add_task(task_list):
    PROMPT user for task description
    APPEND task to task_list

FUNCTION view_tasks(task_list):
    IF task_list is empty:
        DISPLAY "No tasks found"
    ELSE:
        FOR index, task in task_list:
            DISPLAY index and task

FUNCTION remove_task(task_list):
    CALL view_tasks(task_list)
    PROMPT user for index
    TRY:
        CONVERT input to integer
        REMOVE task at index
        DISPLAY "Task removed"
    EXCEPT error:
        DISPLAY "Invalid index"

MAIN PROGRAM:
    CREATE empty task_list
    WHILE True:
        CALL display_menu()
        PROMPT user for option
        IF option == 1:
            CALL add_task(task_list)
        ELIF option == 2:
            CALL view_tasks(task_list)
        ELIF option == 3:
            CALL remove_task(task_list)
        ELIF option == 4:
            DISPLAY "Exiting program"
            BREAK
        ELSE:
            DISPLAY "Invalid choice"

	
ME>> COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:

Should the output includes error messages? INPUTS/OUTPUTS:
- Inputs: user’s menu choice, task description, task index
- Outputs: confirmation messages, task list display

>> AI RESPONSE

Yes — great observation! 👌 It should include error messages under Outputs, especially since the pseudocode handles invalid input (e.g., wrong index, non-integer entry). Including this makes your design complete and realistic

Here’s the corrected version:

✅ INPUTS / OUTPUTS (updated)
vbnet
Copy
Edit
INPUTS:
- User’s menu choice (integer)
- Task description (string)
- Task index to remove (integer)

OUTPUTS:
- Confirmation messages (e.g., "Task added", "Task removed")
- Task list display (indexed)
- Error messages for invalid input (e.g., "Invalid choice", "Invalid index")


COURSE REFERENCE

I used the 6-step planning method from Week 2: Simply Methodology – Computational Thinking to structure my approach.

The menu logic, if/elif conditions, and user options are based on Week 3: Creating Menu, Logical Operators, and Conditionals.

The use of print() and input() comes directly from Week 3: Print & Input.

The program uses functions and parameters following Week 4: Functions & Returning Values, Syntax of a Function.

The while loop and list operations come from Week 5: Lists, Loops, and Slicing.

Finally, the try/except error handling in remove_task() is based on Week 11: Files & Exceptions, where we learned how to prevent crashes with validation logic.

SECTION 1.2: TWO PROMPT REFINEMENTS (12 marks)

ME>> REFINE PROMPT 1. 

Please refine the pseudocode for the command-line Task Manager to improve its reliability. Add error handling when the user:

Enters non-integer input for the menu

Enters an invalid task index

Use only basic try/except, if conditions, and loops. Also, make the output more user-friendly with helpful error messages.

ME>> REFINAMENT PROMPT 2.

Please refine the pseudocode for the Task Manager again. To enhance user experience, could you please refine the code confirming task removal before deletion?.
The program should:

Show the selected task

Ask the user: “Are you sure you want to delete this task? (yes/no)”

Only delete if the user enters “yes” (case-insensitive)

ME>> COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:

Use only basic string handling, input, conditionals, functions, loops.

Absolutely! That's a great enhancement — adding a confirmation step before deleting a task improves usability and prevents accidental deletions.

SECTION 1.3 CRITICAL ANALYSIS 

My initial prompt focused on creating a basic Task Manager using fundamental programming concepts. It applied the structured planning method from Week 2: Computational Thinking, which helped define the problem, inputs/outputs, and key functions.

In the first refinement, I introduced try/except error handling, following the techniques from Week 11: Files & Exceptions, to ensure the program handled invalid inputs safely. I also incorporated print() and input() from Week 3, and used .append() and list operations from Week 5. The use of functions throughout was based on Week 4: Functions & Syntax.

In the second refinement, I enhanced the user experience by adding a confirmation step before task deletion, applying input validation and conditionals from Week 3.

These refinements transformed a simple menu program into a safer and more user-friendly tool, while closely aligning with key skills developed across Weeks 2–5 and Week 1

After I did my own revision I found:

Typo Error (Line 8): if index < len(tas):
'tas' is undefined. It should be 'tasks'.

Variable Name Error (Line 14): for i, t in enumerate(task):
 'task' is undefined. The list is called 'tasks'.

ME>> Initial prompt

Please analyze this buggy Task Manager code and identify errors involving variable names, logic, loops, functions, outputs and others. 

TASK 2.  AI’s Complete Error Analysis:
markdown
Here are the errors in the given code:

1. TYPO ERROR (Line 8):
   - Uses `len(tas)` but the list is named `tasks`.
   - This will raise a NameError.

2. VARIABLE NAME ERROR (Line 14):
   - Uses `enumerate(task)` but the correct variable is `tasks`.
   - Will raise a NameError.

3. FUNCTION NAME ERROR (Line 20):
   - Calls `list_task()` but function is defined as `list_tasks()`.
   - Will raise a NameError.

4. DESIGN NOTE:
   - There's no error handling if `remove_task` is called with a negative index.
   - Could be improved with a condition `if 0 <= index < len(tasks)`.

🔹 3.1 Issue Analysis with Course Connection (6 marks)
🛠️ Task:
List 3 problems in the original safe_weather_data_fetch() function

For each, reference the specific week/topic that addresses it

Then, include your AI prompt for review

✅ Three Problems & Week References:
🔴 Problem 1: No Input Validation

The function does not check if city is empty before making a request.

Solution Concept: Week 6 – User Input Validation

🔴 Problem 2: Catch-all except with no feedback

The outer except block just returns "Error occurred" without explaining what failed.

Solution Concept: Week 8 – Basic Try/Except with Print-Based Feedback

🔴 Problem 3: No nested error handling

If data['current_condition'] is missing or malformed, it crashes silently.

Solution Concept: Week 8 – Safe Data Extraction with Try/Except Nesting


SECTION 3.1  Issue Analysis with Course Connection (6 marks)

TASK 3. Prompt AI: “Review this function using only error handling techniques taught in an introductory programming course (basic try/except only).”

AI > RESPONSE 

Here are three issues with the current `safe_weather_data_fetch()` function:

1. ❌ No Input Validation:
   - The function does not check if the input `city` is an empty string.
   - This could lead to a failed or meaningless API call.
   ✅ Fix: Use `if not city:` to catch empty input.
   ✅ Course Link: Week 3 – Decisions and input validation.

2. ❌ Generic except with no message:
   - The function uses a catch-all `except` that silently fails with "Error occurred".
   - This makes it hard for users to understand what went wrong.
   ✅ Fix: Add a `print()` statement to describe the issue.
   ✅ Course Link: Week 8 – Basic error handling for APIs.

3. ❌ No nested error check for missing/malformed data:
   - Assumes that all keys and indexes exist in the response JSON.
   - If the structure is invalid, it will raise a runtime error.
   ✅ Fix: Add a nested `try/except` inside the outer block.
   ✅ Course Link: Week 8 – Working with unpredictable API responses.


SECTION 3.3 Comparison Analysis (4 marks)
Compare your refined version with the provided ideal version:

ME>> PROMPT 

Please compare my version of the refined_safe_weather_data_fetch(city) function with the provided “ideal” version.
Identify:

Two similarities in approach

Two differences in how complexity is handled

One Week 8 concept that my version demonstrates well

One area I could improve based on the concepts in Textbook Chapter 6

SECTION 3.3

✅ 1. Two Similarities
Input validation:
 Both versions check whether the city value is empty using if not city: before proceeding — a foundational input check taught in Week 3 and reinforced in Week 8.

Basic error handling:
 Both versions use try/except blocks without specifying exception types, as recommended in Week 8, and return None or a dictionary based on outcome.

✅ 2. Two Differences
Error messaging style:
 My version prints plain error messages directly. The ideal version separates messages more clearly with custom descriptions for each failure point. Mine is simpler and more compact.

Structure & readability:
 The ideal version is more readable with slightly clearer nested structure and variable naming (current = data['current_condition'][0]). My version is functionally correct but could benefit from spacing and comments for readability.

✅ 3. Course Concept Demonstrated Best
Basic input validation with fallback logic (Week 8)
My version clearly shows how to combine input checking, error feedback, and basic response handling from an external API using try/except blocks and conditionals.

✅ 4. Improvement Area (from Chapter 6)
Refactor repetition and improve user messaging
After reviewing Chapter 6, I would improve my function by:

Creating a small helper function for error messages to reduce repetition

Making messages more descriptive (e.g. "Connection timeout" or "Invalid API response")
